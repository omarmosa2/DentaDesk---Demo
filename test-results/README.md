# Theme Switching Test Results

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive test results for theme switching functionality in the Dental Clinic application. The tests verify that switching between light and dark modes maintains layout integrity, visual hierarchy, and performance standards.

## Test Coverage

### Layout Integrity Tests
- **CSS Grid Structure**: Verifies grid columns, gaps, and responsive breakpoints work identically in both themes
- **Component Positioning**: Ensures sidebar, main content, and floating actions maintain correct positions
- **Spacing & Alignment**: Checks margins, padding, and text alignment remain consistent
- **Responsive Behavior**: Tests mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts in both themes

### Visual Hierarchy Tests
- **Alert Prominence**: Confirms urgent alerts retain proper visual prominence
- **Interactive Elements**: Verifies buttons and controls maintain accessibility standards
- **Contrast Ratios**: Ensures text contrast meets WCAG guidelines
- **Status Indicators**: Checks color coding for different states remains clear

### Performance Tests
- **Switch Speed**: Measures theme transition time (target: <300ms)
- **Layout Shifts**: Monitors for unexpected reflows during transitions
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks memory consumption during rapid switching
- **Animation Smoothness**: Ensures 60fps during transitions

### RTL Compatibility Tests
- **Text Alignment**: Verifies Arabic text aligns correctly in both themes
- **Icon Positioning**: Checks icons are positioned appropriately for RTL layout
- **Currency Formatting**: Ensures currency symbols appear on correct side
- **Layout Flow**: Confirms overall layout flows correctly in RTL context

## Test Execution

### Automated Tests
Run the automated test suite:

```bash
# From project root
node scripts/run-theme-tests.js
```

### Manual Tests
Access the interactive test component:

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to the Theme Switching Test page
3. Run individual tests or the complete test suite
4. Review results and performance metrics
